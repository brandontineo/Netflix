A spring boot rest applicatio serving data from IMBD.

## Assignment
Design: Movie API
### Part-1
Build an application in Java that pulls movies, their ratings, and cast lists from IMDB. To limit the
scope, please pull only movies released in 2018.
Additional Details:
- IMDB provides details on how to download the data: http://www.imdb.com/interfaces
- You may persist the data however you choose
- APIs is sufficient
### Part-2
For TV series, the ratings on episodes were pretty accurate compared to the season ratings.
Calculate the rating for a season based on its episodes. The way to calculate is simply add
ratings from all episodes within a season, and the number becomes the seasonâ€™s rating.
Please implement method to compute ratings using above algorithm.

- Nice to have: If you think there is a better way to compute the ratings, go ahead and implement
it.

### Part-3
The ratings for episodes are changing constantly, and we want to reflect those changes in our
data. Upgrade you design to synchronize and update the ratings, including re-calculating the
season-level ratings.

- Bonus: Identify areas where you can make the APIs performant and make suggestions/implement on
how you can improve them.

### Delivery
Upload your work to GitHub with a README. We would love to see how you think through the
implementation. Do frequent commits as you progress along with comments. If you have
something drawn on a piece of paper, take a photo and add that as well.

## Data
### Getting to know the Data
The data provided by IMBD is in tsv.gz files hosted on their site and refreshed every 24 hours to reflect the most up to update content. The start building my project I began by inspecting the schema of the different tsv.gz files to see which ones contained the information I would need to completed my tasks.

I decided that I would need the following tsv files: titles.basics, title.episode, title.principals, title.ratings.

Once I had reviewed the schema of the data I decided to do a visual inspection of what the data looked like to get a good idea of how much data wrangling I would need to do with the data. I found that the data files were nicely and properly formatted. However there was missing data  here and there in various columns represented with "\N". Additionally I found that a few of the rows in the tsv files did not use "\N" and instead just had one or two less tabs.

Finally as part of my data exploratory phase I wrote a small script to read in the first 100 rows of the tsv files and print out rows that had missing data or less than the expected number of tabbed values.
