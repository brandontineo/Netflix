## Setting Up Locally

### System Requirements
This project is a Spring Rest Application and can thus be set up if you have the following

- A favorite text editor or IDE
- JDK 1.8 or later
- Maven 3.2+
- Spring Tool Suite IDE (optional)

### Running 
To set up the project locally please clone this repository and import the project as an existing Maven project. If using Eclipse or Spring Tool Suite then the project will automatically set up all the Maven dependencies.

The Spring Rest Application can then be run as a normal java program through the [Application.java](https://github.com/brandontineo/Netflix/blob/master/src/main/java/com/btineo/netflixTakehome/Application.java) class.
